        <p id="p1">Unsupervised learning is a machine learning model that uses unlabeled data (unstructured data) to learn patterns. Unlike supervised learning, the “correctness” of the output isn't known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data without human input (and is thus, unsupervised) and categorizes it into groups based on attributes. For example, if the algorithm is given pictures of apples and bananas, it will work by itself to categorize which picture is an apple and which is a banana. Unsupervised learning is good at descriptive modeling and pattern matching. The most common unsupervised learning algorithms used today include</p><br>
        <p id="p2">Reinforcement learning is a machine learning model that can be described as “learn by doing” through a series of trial and error experiments. An “agent” learns to perform a defined task through a feedback loop until its performance is within a desirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement learning is when Google researchers taught a reinforcement learning algorithm to play the game Go. The model, which had no prior knowledge of the rules of Go, simply moved pieces at random and “learned” the best moves to make. The algorithm was trained by positive and negative reinforcement to the point that the machine learning model could beat a human player at the game.four.</p>
