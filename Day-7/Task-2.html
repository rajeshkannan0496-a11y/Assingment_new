            <li>1 tsp thick tamarind extract</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste </li>
            </ul>
        <h2><li><strong>For the final tempering:</strong></li></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp ghee</li>
            <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
            <li>2–3 dried red chilies</li>
            <li>1 sprig curry leaves</li>
            <li>A pinch of asafoetida</li>
            <li>A handful of cashews</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><li><strong>Instructions</strong></li></h2>
        <ol>


        <li><strong>Pressure cook rice and dal:</strong> Thoroughly rinse the rice and toor dal. Add them to a pressure cooker along with 4 cups of water, turmeric powder, and a teaspoon of oil or ghee. Cook for 4–5 whistles on a medium flame</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the vegetables:</strong> While the rice and dal are cooking, heat a tablespoon of oil in a separate pan. Add the chopped onions or shallots and sauté until translucent. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until soft.</li>
        <li><strong>Add spices and vegetables:</strong> Add the mixed vegetables, sambar powder, and asafoetida. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell of the spices disappears. Add the tamarind extract and bring the mixture to a boil. Simmer for 5–7 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked through and the raw flavor of the tamarind has gone.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and simmer:</strong> Once the pressure has naturally released from the cooker, open it and gently mash the cooked rice and dal. Add this mashed mixture to the pan with the vegetable-sambar base. Mix well and adjust the consistency by adding hot water as needed. Remember that sambar rice thickens as it cools</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the final tempering:</strong> In a small frying pan, heat the ghee. Add the mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add the dried red chilies, curry leaves, and a pinch of asafoetida, then stir for a few seconds. If using, add the cashews and fry until golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong> Pour the tempering over the sambar rice and mix it in gently. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a drizzle of extra ghee if you like. Serve hot with a side of papad, chips, or pickle. </li>
