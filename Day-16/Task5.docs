<JavaScript (JS) has evolved greatly since its creation:
1. **1995 – Birth of JavaScript:**
   Brendan Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days at Netscape to make web pages interactive. It was first called *Mocha*, then *LiveScript*, and finally *JavaScript*.
2. **1997 – Standardization (ECMAScript):**
   JavaScript became standardized as ECMAScript (ES) by ECMA International. ES1 was released in 1997, followed by ES2 (1998) and ES3 (1999).
3. **2009 – ES5 Revolution:**
   ES5 introduced JSON support, `strict mode`, and better object handling. This made JavaScript more stable and widely used.
4. **2015 – ES6 (ECMAScript 2015):**
   A huge upgrade adding `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules—modern JavaScript began here.
5. **2016–Present – Continuous Growth:**
   New versions (ES7, ES8, etc.) are released yearly with features like `async `optional chaining`, and modern APIs. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js expanded JS beyond browsers to full-stack development.
6. **Today – Universal Language:**
   JavaScript now powers web, mobile, desktop, and even AI apps—used everywhere from browsers to servers to IoT.
