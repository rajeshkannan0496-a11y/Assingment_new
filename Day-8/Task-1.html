    <h1 style="border: 3px solid blueviolet; text-align: center; color: deeppink; padding: 1px; background-color: rgb(159, 133, 155);">Women Empowerment</h1>
    <p style="color: darkred; border: 1px solid maroon; border-radius: 11px;padding: 10px; ">Women’s empowerment is the process by which women become aware of gender-based unequal power relationships and acquire a greater voice in which to speak out against the inequality found in the home, workplace, and community. It involves women taking control over their lives: setting their own agendas, gaining skills, solving problems, and developing self-reliance. Women’s empowerment perspective, within the ILO context, is to promote the equal position of women in the world of work, and to further that aim at one or more levels by: 
    Promoting capacity building of women to enable them to participate equally in all societal activities and decision-making at all levels; Promoting equal access to and control over resources and the benefits of productive, reproductive, and community activities by affirmative action for women</p><br><br><hr>
    <p class="para">WEPs are a primary vehicle for corporate delivery on gender equality dimensions of the 2030 agenda and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. By joining the WEPs community, the CEO signals commitment to this agenda at the highest levels of the company and to work collaboratively in multistakeholder networks to foster business practices that empower women. These include equal pay for work of equal value, gender-responsive supply chain practices and zero tolerance against sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
    <hr>
    <p id="p2"> Education is one of the most important means of empowering women with the knowledge, skills and self-confidence necessary to participate fully in the development process. More than 40 years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserted that "everyone has the right to education". In 1990, Governments meeting at the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand, committed themselves to the goal of universal access to basic education. But despite notable efforts by countries around the globe that have appreciably expanded access to basic education, there are approximately 960 million illiterate adults in the world, of whom two thirds are women.</p>
